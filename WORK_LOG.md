| September 11 |  8:10-8:40am  |        I wrote case for when hospital costs less or equal, in which case you just build all hospitals, and then wrote pseudocode for the algorithm for teh other part (lots of thinking and less code writing in this session). |
| September 11 | 10:45-11:25am | I started attempting to use ArrayLists to sort, map, and categorize the clusters. In doing so, I could then just multiply the number of clusters by hospitals, then the number of roads by number of cities in the cluster - 1. |
