| September 11 |  8:10-8:40am  |        I wrote case for when hospital costs less or equal, in which case you just build all hospitals, and then wrote pseudocode for the algorithm for teh other part (lots of thinking and less code writing in this session). |
| September 11 | 10:45-11:25am | I started attempting to use ArrayLists to sort, map, and categorize the clusters. In doing so, I could then just multiply the number of clusters by hospitals, then the number of roads by number of cities in the cluster - 1. |
| September 12 |  10:30-11pm   |                                                                                  Began implementing my first attempt at an algorithm to solve the problem and find the minimum cost. Will update more on success in next entry. |
| September 12 |  11-11:30pm   |                                                 The former algorithm did not work, so I tried to use a queue instead to check for all of the neighbors like in a tree fashion, and it worked. Comments and style coming soon... |
