| September 11 |  8:10-8:40am  |        I wrote case for when hospital costs less or equal, in which case you just build all hospitals, and then wrote pseudocode for the algorithm for teh other part (lots of thinking and less code writing in this session). |
| September 11 | 10:45-11:25am | I started attempting to use ArrayLists to sort, map, and categorize the clusters. In doing so, I could then just multiply the number of clusters by hospitals, then the number of roads by number of cities in the cluster - 1. |
| September 12 |  10:30-11pm   |                                                                                  Began implementing my first attempt at an algorithm to solve the problem and find the minimum cost. Will update more on success in next entry. |
| September 12 |  11-11:30pm   |                                                 The former algorithm did not work, so I tried to use a queue instead to check for all of the neighbors like in a tree fashion, and it worked. Comments and style coming soon... |
| September 12 | 11:30-11:50pm |                                                                                 Wrote comments to understand the process of my first attempt, especially for when I go back and make changes later before the final submission. |
| September 18 |  1:15-1:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                    Tried to convert path compression and weight balancing pseudocode into code. |
| September 19 |   9-9:30pm    |                                                                                                                         I used the code from teh reading to try another attempt, but it still failed, debugging and fixing now. |
| September 19 | 9:30-10:30pm  |                                                                         Here's my next attempt. This seems better. I deleted my previous attempts and retried. I got path compression to work. Working on weight balancing now. |
